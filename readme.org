* Global Mode Line

[[./global-mode-line.png]]

Display mode-line content in tab-bar.

* Install

This is not in either Elpa nor Melpa, so you will have to either clone this repository or just download raw global-mode-line.el somewhere where your Emacs can find it.

If you have cloned this repository, you can also install global-mode-line.el via M-x package-install-file.

* Usage

To enable/disable dired-auto-readme-mode: M-x global-mode-line-mode.

* Known Problems

This mode uses tab-bar to display mode-line, so you can't use this if you would like to use tab-bar mode for what it is intended :).

If you like to use mouse with your mode-line and click on various interactive elements, don't use this either, since this looses all the interactivity of mode-line.

Unless your Emacs is configured to display horizontal scrollbars, you will also loose the clear visual separation between horizontal windows.

* About

I made this as an answer to an anonymous question on Reddit, and is really just a small test of an idea, don't rely on this to be fool-prof and without bugs.

If you manage to somehow fix good, thin-line (1px wide) rendering of mode-line, please let me know, and if you have bug fixes, improvements, etc, it is free to open PR or an issue.
