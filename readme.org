* Global Mode Line

[[./global-mode-line.png]]

Display mode-line content in tab-bar.

* Install

This is not yet in either Elpa nor Melpa, so currently you will have to either clone this repository or just download raw global-mode-line.el somewhere where your Emacs can find it.

If you clone this repository, you can install globel-mode-line.el via M-x package-install-file.

* Usage

To enable/disable dired-auto-readme-mode: M-x global-mode-line-mode.

* Known Problems

This mode uses tab-bar to display mode-line, so you can't use this with tab-bar mode.

If you like to use mouse with your mode-line and click on various interactive elements, don't use this either, since this looses all the interactivity of mode-line.

Unless your Emacs is configured to display horizontal scrollbars, you will also loose the clear visual separation between horizontal windows.

* About

I made this as an answer to an anonymous question on Reddit, and is really just a small prototype of an idea.
